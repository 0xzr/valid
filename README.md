## 2. SSV projects & resources

### Staking pools

- [GARUDA](https://github.com/RohitAudit/ssv-service) - Garuda ssv-service

  - User stakes their eth to a staking contract through which he is given a liquid staked derivative token called roETH. That's it!! User can just relax and wait for their roETH to compound over time and till then use the same tokens in other DeFi protocols

- [FRENS](github.com/frens-pool) - stake with friends

  - Staking pools for peer-to-peer staking on trusted node operators (friends)

### Staking services

### Operator services

- [Stereum](https://github.com/stereum-dev/ethereum-node/) - a Node Setup GUI that build an easy SSV Network Operator Setup.

  - If you got an Ubuntu server, you can use Stereum's Node tool to connect to it and install / maintain a SSV Operator without having to access the CLI. If you have any question about it, let us know ðŸ˜„.

- [ChainUp Cloud](https://cloud.chainup.com/) â€” ChainUp Cloud is an All in one SSV platform

- [SSV Network contractor(built by Ankr)](https://github.com/Ankr-network/ssv-network-contractor) â€” GRPC service for registering validators in SSV Network contract.
  - Using the official Key Distributer SDK service can calculate initial funding and register a validator from received JSON keystorage.
