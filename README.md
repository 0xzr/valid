## 2. SSV projects & resources

### Staking pools

- [GARUDA](https://github.com/RohitAudit/ssv-service) - Garuda ssv-service

  - User stakes their eth to a staking contract through which he is given a liquid staked derivative token called roETH. That's it!! User can just relax and wait for their roETH to compound over time and till then use the same tokens in other DeFi protocols

- [FRENS](github.com/frens-pool) - stake with friends

  - Staking pools for peer-to-peer staking on trusted node operators (friends)

### Notification services

- [HAL](https://app.hal.xyz/) - The Crypto Notification System

  - Hal has built a custom Notify Recipe for SSV that allows SSV users to automatically monitor and get custom notifications for monitoring, operation runway, operator fee change and many more SSV protocol related events. Users will set up their notification using the Hal Notify app and then receive their notifications on the channel or their preference (email, telegram, discord, etc.)

- [Hellman - allerts](https://alert.hellman.team/metrics) / [Hellman - repo](https://github.com/HellmanResearch)

  - HellmanAlert is a monitoring of SSV.Network, which mainly provides operators/users with 7\*24 hours monitoring of account balance, operation performance & status.

### Staking services

### Tools

- [SSV Keys's Go implementation](https://github.com/duktig666/ssv-keys-go)
  - This is the Go implementation of the [ssv-keys repository](https://github.com/bloxapp/ssv-keys). The use case is for those who prefer generating keyshares using the Go language over Javascript/Typescript.
